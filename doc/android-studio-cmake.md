## Setup
This step creates a new Android Studio CMake project to use in this tutorial. If you already have a project to use then you can skip it.

1. Start Android Studio 2.2 or later
2. File->New->New project...
3. Click Include C++ Support checkbox
4. Next, next
5. Choose Empty Activity
6. Next, next, finish

## Step 1 -- Add CDep tool to the root of the project
At this point you should have a project open in Android Studio. Open a terminal window by clicking Terminal. It is usually in the lower part of Android Studio.
